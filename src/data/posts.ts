    content: `## You Don't Need Another App. You Need a Different Phone.

Every year, another "digital wellness" app launches. Screen time trackers. Grayscale modes. App blockers. They all share the same fundamental flaw: they ask you to use your phone to fight your phone.

That's like keeping a bottle of whiskey on your desk to practice willpower.

The real solution is simpler: **carry a phone that doesn't have the problem.**

## What Makes a Phone "Intentional"?

An intentional phone does three things well: calls, texts, and maybe a camera. It does not do the following:

- **No infinite scroll.** No social media feeds, no algorithmic content, no "one more video" rabbit holes.
- **No app store.** You can't install the thing you're trying to avoid.
- **No browser worth using.** If browsing is painful, you won't browse.

The friction is the feature. When texting requires pressing the 7 key four times to type the letter "s," you think about whether that text is worth sending.

## Our Top Picks

### Nokia 2780 Flip — $88.99
The best all-around option. 4G connectivity means it works on modern networks. KaiOS gives you the basics without the baggage. The flip mechanism adds a satisfying physical ritual to every call — you open it to begin, close it to end. That's a boundary your smartphone never gives you.

**Best for:** Families transitioning kids off smartphones, adults doing a full digital detox.

### Light Phone II — $299
The premium option. Built from the ground up by former Google employees who understood the attention economy and chose to build its opposite. E-ink display, minimal tools, gorgeous design. This is the phone you carry when you want people to ask "what is that?"

**Best for:** Adults who want a daily driver that's intentionally minimal.

### Any Flip Phone Under $50
If you're not sure this lifestyle is for you, buy the cheapest flip phone at your local store and try it for a week. The specific model doesn't matter. What matters is the experience of carrying a device that doesn't compete for your attention.

**Best for:** Experimenting before committing.

## The First Week Is the Hardest

You'll reach for your pocket constantly. You'll feel phantom vibrations. You'll have moments of genuine anxiety when you can't immediately Google something.

This is withdrawal. It's real, it passes, and what's on the other side is worth it.

After about 7 days, something shifts. You start noticing things. The texture of a conversation. The way light moves through a room. The feeling of being bored — actually bored — and what your mind does when it's not fed a constant stream of content.

That's your attention coming back online.

## The Bottom Line

The best phone for a digital detox is the one you'll actually carry. Start cheap if you're unsure. Go premium if you're committed. Either way, the answer isn't another app — it's a different device entirely.

The friction is where your freedom lives.`,

    content: `## The Problem With Screen Time Rules

Most families handle technology the same way: parents set rules for kids, and kids resent them.

"No phones at dinner." "Only 2 hours of screen time." "No devices after 9pm."

These rules fail for one reason: **they only apply to the children.**

Kids aren't stupid. They see you scrolling Instagram during dinner. They watch you check email at 11pm. They notice when you can't put your phone down during a family movie.

Rules without shared accountability aren't rules. They're surveillance.

## What a Technology Contract Changes

A family technology contract flips the script. Everyone signs. Everyone follows the same rules. Parents included.

This changes three things:

### 1. It Removes the Power Dynamic
When dad can't check his phone at dinner either, the rule stops being about control and starts being about shared values. Kids stop feeling policed and start feeling part of something.

### 2. It Makes Violations Visible
When the contract is on the fridge, everyone can see it. When mom picks up her phone during a device-free time, the kids can (respectfully) point to the contract. Accountability flows in both directions.

### 3. It Creates a Shared Language
Instead of "put your phone away," you get "remember our contract." Instead of arguments about fairness, you get conversations about commitment. The contract becomes a reference point, not a weapon.

## What Goes in a Technology Contract?

Every family is different, but most contracts cover:

- **Screen time limits** — How much daily screen time, weekday vs. weekend
- **Device-free zones** — Rooms where no devices are allowed (dinner table, bedrooms)
- **Device-free times** — When devices get put away (meals, bedtime, morning routines)
- **Consequences** — What happens when someone breaks the contract (applied equally)
- **Rewards** — What happens when someone honors it consistently
- **Review dates** — When the family revisits and updates the contract together

## How to Create One

You can use our [free contract builder](/contract/create) to walk through a 9-step wizard that generates a printable contract. Or download a [blank PDF template](/blank-contract.pdf) and fill it out by hand together.

The important thing isn't the format — it's the conversation. Sitting down as a family and deciding together what your relationship with technology looks like is the most valuable part.

## Start Imperfect

Your first contract won't be perfect. The limits might be too strict or too loose. Someone will break the rules in the first week (probably a parent).

That's fine. The contract isn't about perfection — it's about intention. It's about a family deciding together that their attention matters, that their time together matters, and that they're willing to create friction between impulse and action to protect it.

That friction is where the connection lives.`,

    content: `## The Analog Revival Isn't Nostalgia

Vinyl sales have outpaced CDs for years. Film photography is booming among Gen Z. Notebook sales are at record highs. Fountain pen communities are thriving.

The easy explanation is nostalgia. The real explanation is friction.

## What Digital Took Away

Digital tools optimized for one thing: removing friction. Every click, every tap, every swipe was engineered to be as effortless as possible.

The result? We do everything faster and experience nothing deeper.

- **Digital photography** gave us unlimited shots and instant gratification. It also gave us 10,000 photos we never look at and no memory of taking any of them.
- **Streaming music** gave us every song ever recorded. It also turned music into wallpaper — something that plays in the background while we do something else.
- **Note-taking apps** gave us perfect sync and infinite storage. They also let us capture thoughts without processing them, creating graveyards of ideas we never revisited.

The friction wasn't a bug. It was the part that made the experience meaningful.

## What Analog Gives Back

### Commitment
When you load 36 exposures into a film camera, every shot costs money and attention. You don't spray and pray. You wait, compose, and commit. That commitment is what makes the photo matter — to you, in the moment you take it.

### Presence
When you drop a needle on a vinyl record, you've committed to 20 minutes of one album, one artist, one mood. You don't skip tracks (not easily). You sit with the artist's sequencing, their vision for how the songs flow together. Music becomes an activity, not a background process.

### Depth
When you write in a notebook with a fountain pen, you can't type 80 words per minute. You write maybe 15. That slowness forces your brain to compress, prioritize, and process. Studies consistently show that handwriting improves retention and comprehension compared to typing.

### Tangibility
A shelf of vinyl records is a physical autobiography. A box of developed film is a tactile timeline. A filled notebook is proof of thinking. Digital files exist nowhere — they're abstractions in a cloud. Analog objects exist in the world, and so do the memories attached to them.

## You Don't Have to Choose

This isn't about abandoning digital tools. It's about being intentional about which tools you use for which purposes.

Use a spreadsheet for your budget. Use a notebook for your journal. Use Spotify to discover music. Use vinyl to actually listen to it. Use your phone camera for documentation. Use a film camera for art.

The question isn't "analog or digital?" The question is: **"Does this tool help me be present, or does it help me avoid presence?"**

Choose accordingly.

## Starter Kit

If you're curious about analog tools, here's where to start:

- **Photography:** A [Kodak M35](/shop/kodak-m35-film-camera) and a roll of Kodak Gold 200
- **Music:** An [Audio-Technica turntable](/shop/audio-technica-at-lp60x) and three albums you love
- **Writing:** A [Leuchtturm1917 notebook](/shop/leuchtturm1917-hardcover) and a [Lamy Safari fountain pen](/shop/lamy-safari-fountain-pen)

Total investment: under $300. Total return: immeasurable.

The friction is the feature. The slowness is the point. And what you get back — presence, depth, commitment — is something no app can deliver.`,
